OUTLINE
I have mutliple hard drives that have differnt names

one is Backup(E:)
Another is
Local Disk(F:)

they are not plugged in at all times, can i make it so that 15 minutes before its about to backup it sends a notificaiton on my computer saying backup in 15 minutes, you should plug in your hard drives. 

In the S3 bucket for each backup can you make it so that, it creates a folder for each one for example

For the main computer it should say MAIN
for the F: it should say White Hard Drive
for the E: it should say Black Hard Drive

and it should have all the folders and files there 

Also in the email say how long it took aswell

Every Friday At Night let it backup all my files
