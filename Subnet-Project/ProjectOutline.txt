Cloud VM Subnetting Playground — Project Description

Project goal
Build a small, realistic AWS network to learn how subnets, routing, ARP, security groups, and flow logs work, while practicing cloud security fundamentals.

What I built (short)
Two Ubuntu EC2 instances running in the same VPC and the same subnet, configured Security Groups, observed ARP and routing behavior, tested connectivity using ping and traceroute, and sent VPC Flow Logs to CloudWatch encrypted with a KMS key.

Environment & tools

AWS: VPC, single Subnet, EC2 (Ubuntu), Network Interfaces (ENIs), Elastic IPs

CloudWatch Logs (Flow Logs) + KMS for encryption

Linux commands: ip a, ip route, ip neigh, ping, traceroute, tcpdump

SSH / SCP from laptop for access and file transfer

Key steps completed

Designed one VPC with a single subnet in the 172.31.0.0/20 range

Launched two Ubuntu EC2 instances in the same subnet and verified private IPs

Configured Security Groups to allow SSH and ICMP only from trusted sources

Assigned Elastic IPs for public SSH access only when needed

Tested connectivity: ping, traceroute, and verified ARP entries appear after traffic

Created a CloudWatch Log Group and enabled VPC Flow Logs for the subnet

Created a KMS key with a secure key policy; configured Flow Logs to use the KMS key for encryption at rest

Verified logs in CloudWatch and filtered for ICMP traffic to observe ping records

Security controls implemented

Least-privilege Security Group rules (SSH restricted to my IP, ICMP limited)

Subnet design with controlled public access via Elastic IPs

VPC Flow Logs enabled for visibility and monitoring

KMS encryption for CloudWatch logs; IAM role allowed CloudWatch to write logs

Checked NACLs and confirmed local routing inside the VPC

What I learned / outcomes

How private IPs work in AWS (live in the subnet) and public IPs are NATed for internet access

How ARP and routing behave inside a single subnet

How Security Groups and Flow Logs interact: SGs control traffic, Flow Logs capture accept/reject events

How to secure logs with KMS and verify them in CloudWatch

Practical troubleshooting steps for SSH, ENIs, Elastic IPs, and Flow Logs
